## Overview
This release focuses on critical bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as usability enhancements based on user feedback. The following fixes and updates are included in this version.

## Bug Fixes

### 1. PAN Search Issue
**Description**: Fixed the issue where PAN search displayed more results than expected. Now, only the searched PAN will appear.  
**Steps to reproduce**:  
Go to: `crm -> Channel Partner`

### 2. Pending Calls Display
**Description**: The "Pending Calls" section now correctly displays the data as expected.  
**Steps to reproduce**:  
Go to: `crm -> Reports -> Call Report -> Call Pending`

### 3. Logs Redirection Issue
**Description**: Fixed the issue where clicking on the "Logs" button redirected users unexpectedly. Now, it correctly takes users to the Logs page.  
**Steps to reproduce**:  
Go to: `crm -> Finance -> Claims -> Payout -> Logs`

### 4. Billers Visibility
**Description**: Billers will no longer be shown under the "Channel Partner" section.  
**Steps to reproduce**:  
Go to: `crm -> Channel Partner`

### 5. Add Billers Validation
**Description**: The issue where submitting new details in the "Add Billers" section resulted in an error has been resolved. If a DSA with the same PAN, email, or mobile already exists, a proper validation message will be shown before submission.  
**Steps to reproduce**:  
Go to: `crm -> Biller`

### 6. Missing "Business Category" in Leads
**Description**: The "Business Category" field was left blank in the leads data, even though it is a necessary field. Now, users will receive an error message if they attempt to submit the form without entering a business category.  
**Steps to reproduce**:  
Go to: `crm -> Finance -> Claim -> Payout -> Business Category Column`

## Enhancements & Improvements

- Last Modified By  
- Address (Only City, State, and Pincode remain)  
**Steps to reproduce**:  
Go to: `crm -> Billers`

### 2. PAN Card Auto-Conversion
**Description**: PAN card numbers will now automatically convert to uppercase when entered.  
**Steps to reproduce**:  
Go to: `crm -> Billers`

## New Features Added

### 1. Reference Icon in Multi-Funded Pending
**Description**: A reference icon has been added in the "Multi-Funded Pending" section, allowing users to view related cases with similar references easily. The same multi-funded logic is now applied to deleted and sent-to-ERP cases as well.  
**Steps to reproduce**:  
Go to: `crm -> Finance -> Payout -> Progress -> Multi-Funded Pending -> View Reference Icon`
