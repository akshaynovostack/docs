This guide explains how to prevent loan numbers from shrinking in Excel, especially when dealing with numbers that exceed the default character limit.  

## Problem  
Excel may shorten or alter large numbers, especially loan numbers, due to its default formatting. This typically happens when the number of digits exceeds what Excel displays in a "General" format. According to the video, Excel supports up to 11 characters in a single row or cell. If you increase the number of characters beyond this limit, the numbers may get shortened or displayed incorrectly.  

## Solution  
The solution involves changing the cell format to "Number" and adjusting decimal settings.  

### Steps  
1.  **Select the Cell(s):** Choose the cell or range of cells containing the loan numbers.  
2.  **Go to the Home Tab:** In Excel's ribbon, click on the "Home" tab.  
3.  **Find the Number Format Dropdown:** In the "Home" section, you will find a dropdown box for numbering. This dropdown likely says "General" by default.  
4.  **Change to "Number" Format:** Select "Number" from the dropdown menu. This tells Excel to treat the cell content as a numerical value.  
5.  **Adjust Decimal Places:** After changing to the "Number" format, Excel might display two decimal places by default. To remove these decimals, click the "Decrease Decimal" button until the decimals are removed.  

### Explanation  

*   **General Format:** Excel's "General" format tries to be smart about displaying data, but it can misinterpret large numbers, especially those exceeding 11 digits, leading to shrinking or scientific notation.  
*   **Number Format:** By changing the format to "Number," you instruct Excel to treat the cell's content strictly as a numerical value, preserving all digits.  
*   **Decimal Adjustment:** Adjusting the decimal places ensures the numbers are displayed cleanly without extra decimal points.  

## FAQs  

### What is the maximum number of characters Excel supports in a cell?  

According to the video, Excel supports up to 11 characters in a single cell before numbers start to shrink. However, Excel can support up to 32,767 characters in a single cell, but the display might be affected by the cell's width and format settings.  

### How do you change a cell's format in Excel?  

1.  Select the cell(s).  
2.  Go to the "Home" tab.  
3.  Use the dropdown menu in the "Number" section to choose a format like "Number," "Currency," or "Text."  

### What happens to numbers exceeding Excel's character limit?  

If a number exceeds Excel's display capabilities under the "General" format, it might be displayed in scientific notation or truncated. Changing the cell format to "Number" or "Text" can prevent this. The video demonstrates that numbers with more than 11 characters get shortened.
