## Introduction

The **Ruloans CRM Finance Module** is designed to streamline financial processes within the CRM, ensuring efficient handling of transactions, claims, payouts, and case management. This document provides a detailed overview of the module's workflow as represented in the flowchart.

## Overview of the Payout Module

The **Payout Module** consists of four primary stages:

1. **Awaited**

2. **In Progress**

3. **Processed**

4. **Rejected**

Each stage contains specific sub-processes that manage the flow of financial cases through the CRM system.

### 1. Awaited Stage

The **Awaited** stage is the initial phase where cases require specific actions before moving forward.

* **Claim Pending:** Cases that are awaiting claim initiation. These leads come from both the App and the Web App.

* **Payout Pending:** Cases awaiting payout processing. These cases belong to DSAs whose payout is not yet set and will remain in this status until configured.

  **Note:** Cases under "Payout Pending" status have no assigned payout for the **Direct Selling Agent (DSA).**

### 2. In Progress Stage

In the **In Progress** stage, cases are actively being processed.

* **Multi-Funded Pending:** Cases that exist in the data but are duplicated due to new entries with the same details. These require validation to prevent duplication and funding conflicts.

* **Banker Confirmation Pending:** Cases awaiting confirmation from the banker.

* **Pending:** Cases on hold for review. After review, they are either sent to ERP for processing or deleted if issues are identified.

### 3. Processed Stage

Once cases progress through the previous stages, they reach the **Processed** status.

* **Sent to ERP:** Cases forwarded to the ERP system for integration.

* **Approved Cases:** Cases that have been reviewed and approved.

* **WIP Cases (Work in Progress):** Cases still being handled.

* **Not Found Cases:** Cases that could not be located within the system.

* **Error Cases:** Cases with issues that require resolution.

### 4. Rejected Stage

Cases that do not meet requirements or encounter unresolved issues are moved to the **Rejected** stage.

* **Multi-Funded Confirmed:** Cases rejected due to confirmed multi-funding conflicts.

* **Deleted:** Cases removed from the system.

## Understanding the Flow of Cases in CRM

### Starting with Manual Entry, App, Web App, and Excel Import

Cases entered manually, through Excel import, or via the App and Web App follow the process outlined below:

After data entry, cases are categorized into the appropriate sections:

* **Claim Pending**

* **Payout Pending**

* **Pending**

* **Banker Confirmation Pending**

* **Multi-Funded Pending**

#### Claim Pending

Cases submitted via the App or Web App with pending claims are categorized under "Claim Pending." Users can claim cases by clicking the **"Claim"** button, shifting them into one of the following:

* **Pending:** Cases on hold for review before being forwarded to **NS**.

* **Payout Pending:** Cases where the DSA's payout is not yet set.

* **Banker Confirmation Pending:** Cases awaiting confirmation from the banker.

#### Payout Pending

Cases in **Payout Pending** require DSA payout configuration. Users can navigate to the DSA's profile by clicking the **dollar icon** and setting up the payout. After configuration, cases shift to:

* **Pending:** Cases on hold for review.

* **Banker Confirmation Pending:** Cases awaiting confirmation from the banker.

#### Pending

This section contains cases that are ready for review. From here, cases can either be:

* **Sent to ERP:** If reviewed and approved, cases are forwarded to the ERP system.

* **Deleted:** Cases that do not qualify for processing.

#### Banker Confirmation Pending

Cases in this section await banker confirmation. Once received, the case moves to the **Pending** section for review.

#### Multi-Funded Pending

Cases with duplicate details matching an existing entry require validation to prevent funding conflicts. Possible outcomes include:

* **Multi-Funded Confirmed:** If the case is confirmed as multi-funded.

* **Rejected:** If the case is deemed ineligible due to duplication.

### Understanding the Processed and Rejected Sections

#### Processed

* **Sent To ERP:** Cases successfully forwarded to the ERP system for integration and managed by **NS.**

* **Approved Cases:** Cases review
