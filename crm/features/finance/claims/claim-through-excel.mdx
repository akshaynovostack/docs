## Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step guide for preparing and uploading vendor claim files in CRM. It is intended for new users of the CRM system to ensure accurate and efficient claim processing.

## Preparing the Vendor Claim File in Excel

### 1. Accessing the CRM MIS Upload Format

* Open the payout claim format file.

* Refer to the "CRM MIS Upload Format" sheet.

### 2. Following Instructions

* The first row contains instructions and explanations for each column.

* Pay close attention to the mandatory fields, which must be filled accurately.

### 3. Starting from the Second Row

* Begin entering data from the second row, where the headers are located.

* Do not use the first row for data entry.

### 4. Selecting Data from Drop-Down Lists

* Use the drop-down lists for fields like month and bank names.

* Avoid manual typing to ensure data consistency.

### 5. Mandatory Fields

* **Customer Loan Number:** Enter the customer's loan number.

* **Split Disbursal Date:** Enter the disbursal date.

* **Loan Amount:** Enter the loan amount.

* **Vendor PAN Number:** This is a critical field. The PAN number must be mapped under your CRM profile.

* **Bank Name:** Select the appropriate bank name from the drop-down list.

* **Product:** Select the main product (e.g., PL, BL, HL, LAB) rather than sub-products.

* **Rate/Ratio:** Specify the rate or ratio committed to the vendor.

* **Business Category:** Select the appropriate business category (e.g., 11 for Loan to VC).

### 6. Optional Fields

* **Customer Name:** Enter the full name of the customer.

* **City Leader Name/Code & Sub Leader Name:** Leave blank if you don't have the code.

* **Vendor's Name:** If available, enter the vendor's name.

* **Vendor Remark:** Add any relevant comments or remarks.

### 7. Understanding Codes

* **Bank Codes:** After selecting the bank, the corresponding bank code will appear. If you see "N/A" or a similar error, the bank may not be listed, or the format may be corrupted.

* **Product Codes:** Selecting the main product will populate the corresponding product code.

### 8. Handling Corrupted Files

* If the format is corrupted, request a new file.

* Alternatively, copy the necessary codes from the product master file.

* Do not use corrupted files.

### 9. Rate vs. Ratio

* **Rate:** A fixed percentage paid to the vendor irrespective of the bank's payout.

* **Ratio:** A percentage of the payout received from the bank that is passed on to the vendor.

* Select the appropriate option based on your commitment to the vendor.

### 10. Split Payments

* Avoid split payments to multiple vendors for a single case.

* Split payments complicate the TDS process.

### 11. Borrower and Company Names

* For BL (Business Loan) or LAB cases, the loan is typically booked under the company's name.

* Capture the company name in the "Borrower Name" column and the proprietor/director name in the "Company Name" column.

* If unsure, mention the customer name and bank name in columns V and W, respectively.

### 12. Business Category Codes

* Select the appropriate business category code.

* "11" is generally used for fresh loan cases (Loan to VC).

* "21" is used for tranche cases (Loan TR) when uploading subsequent tranches of a home loan.

## Uploading the Vendor Claim File in CRM

### 1. Preparing the Data

* Select the data from the second row to the last row with data.

* Copy the selected data (Ctrl+C).

* Open a new Excel file (Ctrl+N).

* Paste the copied data using "Paste Special" and select "Values."

* Format the date columns to a standard date format.

### 2. Saving the File

* Save the file with a descriptive name, including the month, lot number, and date (e.g., "VendorClaims\_December2024\_Lot1\_03052025").

* Proper naming conventions help in tracking files within CRM and in logs.

### 3. Uploading to CRM

* Log in to CRM.

* Navigate to "Lead Form" > "Payout Claims" > "Pending Import" > "Upload Excel."

* Select the prepared file and open it.

* Click "Add" to upload the file.

### 4. Processing and Verification

* The system will take a few minutes to load the data.

* Once loaded, the cases will appear in the pending section.

* Verify the uploaded data for accuracy.

* Update the rate or ratio if needed.

### 5. Sending to ERP

* Select the cases.

* Click "Send to ERP."

* The selected cases will move to the "Sent to ERP" section.

### 6. Verifying Submission

* In the "Sent to ERP" section, check for the internal UE and CRM ID.

* The generation of these IDs confirms that the claim has reached the MIS team in Mumbai.

## Troubleshooting

* **File Errors:** If you encounter errors during upload, ensure that all mandatory fields are correctly filled and that the file format is correct.

* **Bank/Product Codes:** If bank or product codes are not populating, verify the bank and product names and ensure that the master file is not corrupted.

* **Duplicate Claims:** If you receive a duplicate claim error, ensure that you are using the correct business category code (e.g., "21" for tranche cases).
